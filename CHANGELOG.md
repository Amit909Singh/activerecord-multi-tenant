## 0.8.0       2017-08-16

* Significant improvements and simplifications of query rewriting
  * Big thanks to [Kyle Bock](https://github.com/kwbock) and [Ben Olive](https://github.com/sionide21)
    for (re-)writing this code and verifying it works well
  * This fixes caching issues across multiple MultiTenant.with { } blocks when
    interacting with the Rails statement cache

    least Rails 4.0
